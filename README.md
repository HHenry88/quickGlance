Website that uses New York Times API to put headlines in an efficient format

quickGlance allowes users to search quickly through the New York Times headlines without the site's newspaper format. 
I could have condensed the sports, technology, and worldnews pages and put them into the more code. However I wanted to write try writing it seperate a few times to learn. Also I believe it could be a reference in the future for myself and others if we want to not have a page directed by an expression. 

## Tools 
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap 3
- New York Times API

## Structure
  For the most part for my config, modules and controllers I used the John Papa's AngularJS style guide (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). 
  
## Future updates
  * Add a search option
  * Update the API to use an API that allows me the display the actual news articles on the site rather than have to redirect to the New York Times site for the article.
